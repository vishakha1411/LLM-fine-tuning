# Fine-Tuning LLM Models 

This repository contains **fine-tuning experiments of multiple Transformer and LLM-based models** for suicide ideation and mental health text classification using **public Kaggle datasets**.

All models are trained using **efficient fine-tuning techniques (e.g., LoRA)** to reduce compute and memory usage.
